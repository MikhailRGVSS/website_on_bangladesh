However, they have exams at the end of every year, and they have a similar branch but they incorporate religious studies into the curriculum. After tertiary education, one can go into college and university. They have improved their education a lot in the 21st century. Less than half the population could read or write around the 2000's, but by the late 2010's, more than two-thirds of the population were literate. There are over 100 universities and colleges in Bangladesh.</p>
