              <h2>Discovery of the Weyl Fermion</h2>
              <img src="https://mahfujalam.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/m-zahid-hasan.jpg">
              <p>M Zahid Hasan is a Bangladeshi physicist of Princeton University. He had amazing results in notable universities, which put him on the radar. He was enrolled into University of Texas, and got his PhD from Stanford University. After he got his degree, he went to Princeton University to be a lecturer. Now, he is a Professor of Physics, especially in the field of Quantum Condensed Matter. He helped discover a massless particle, called the Weyl fermion. It has been theorized for 85 years by Hermann Weyl. The discovery showed electrons that behaved together rather than by themselves, which is how massless particles act. If the Weyl fermion is applied to electronic devices, they can create a more efficient flow of power with very little energy loss. They could also have potential applications in technology of the next generation. </p>

              <h2>Simple Arsenic Filter</h2>
              <img src="https://content.time.com/time/europe/magazine/2007/1029/hussam_1029.jpg" >
              <p>Abul Hussam (Dr. Hussam) created an arsenic filter for water after there was an arsenic problem in the 90s. His first product was made in 1999, but he wanted to improve it. He finally finished the product and released it in 2001. He created it so it is simple but effective. He uses cheap materials like wood charcoal, river sand, and brick chips. You do not need to pretreat the water and the filtration system has no chemicals involved. It serves two families for at least five years, removes 98% of the arsenic content in the water, and only costs $35 per unit.</p>

              <h2>Improved Electrical Focused Impedance</h2>
              <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/Dr._Khondkar_Siddique-e-Rabbani_8.jpg">
              <p>Khondkar Siddique-e Rabbani improved electrical focused impedance by finding ways to scan parts of your body that are under a lot of muscle. Before it only could reach the shallow parts of your body, which did not make it as effective as other methods. However, this discovery led to it becoming more widely used. This discovery can save the lives of many, as it can help measure internal organs and check the conditions of it, preventing possible growth of tumours or fluid accumulation. Impedance is resistance in circuits, but resistance is specifically used for direct currents, while impedance is used for alternating currents. Bioelectrical Impedance helps scan your body for things like how much body fat or how much water is in your body. This could be preferred by many as it measures your body in non-intrusively.
